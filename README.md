# AHB2APB-bridge
**ABSTRACT:**

The Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture (AMBA) is an open 
System-on-Chip bus protocol for high performance buses to 
communicate with low-power devices. In the AMBA High-performance 
Bus (AHB) a system bus is used to connect a processor, a DSP, and 
high-performance memory controllers where as the AMBA Advanced 
Peripheral Bus (APB) is used to connect (Universal Asynchronous 
Receiver Transmitter) UART. It also contains a Bridge, which connects 
the AHB and APB buses. Bridges are standard bus-to-bus interfaces that 
allow IPs connected to different buses to communicate with each other 
in a standardized way.

**AHB2APB BRIDGE:**

The AHB to APB bridge interface is an AHB slave. When accessed (in normal 
operation or system test) it initiates an access to the APB. APB accesses are of 
different duration (three HCLK cycles in the EASY for a read, and two cycles for a 
write). They also have their width fixed to one word, which means it is not possible 
to write only an 8-bit section of a 32-bit APB register. APB peripherals do not need 
a PCLK input as the APB access is timed with an enable signal generated by the 
AHB to APB bridge interface. This makes APB peripherals low power consumption 
parts, because they are only strobed when accessed.
